Here's a few things I have worked on in the past few years:

## Unreleased Cart Game

A game I worked on for a few months that didn't end up getting released. Features a customizable cart system with a shop, obstacles and abilities for your cart.

## Path Plugin

A plugin I made to create and manage paths. Originally made for moving platforms but is usable for anything that needs to move along a preset path. The UI is made in Fusion.

## Rope Swinging Test

Little prototype for a swinging game idea I had. It didn't end up going anywhere, but it sure is fun to play around with.

## Visibility Test

A little experiment I did to accurately check if an AABB is in view of the player. Uses basic frustum checks and raycasts. Can be used for enemies, illusions, etc.

## Triangle Terrain Generator

A terrain generator using triangles I made a while back for a game I scrapped.

## Simple Car System

A very very simple car system I made to learn the basics. I used a more advanced version for the cart game project.

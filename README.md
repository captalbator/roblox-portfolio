# loudbytes' Roblox Portfolio

This portfolio is for smaller projects that were mostly made for learning and/or fun.

## Path Plugin

A plugin I made to create and manage paths. Originally made for moving platforms but is usable for anything that needs to move along a preset path. The UI is made in Fusion.

## Rope Swinging Test

Little prototype for a swinging game idea I had. It didn't end up going anywhere but I might pick it back up again.

## Visibility Test

A little experiment I did to accurately check if an AABB is in view of the player. Uses basic frustum checks and raycasts.

## Triangle Terrain Generator

A terrain generator I made a while back for a game I scrapped. It was pretty slow, which is why I didn't end up using it.

A very very simple car system.
